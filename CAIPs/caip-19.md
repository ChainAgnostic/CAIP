## Simple Summary

CAIP-19 defines a way to identify a type of asset (e.g. Bitcoin, Ether, ATOM) and an asset ID (for a non-fungible token) in a human-readable, developer and transaction friendly way.

## Abstract

Often you need to reference the asset type or the asset ID. For example when you want to do an atomic swap between a fungible asset and a non-fungible asset.

## Motivation

Currently, each wallet or each exchange needs to create their own registry of type of assets and their associated metadata for example like [Trust-Wallet](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/tree/master/blockchains) or [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). Providing a unique type of Asset and an Asset ID for each asset for developers can reduce the risk of confusion between different assets.

## Specification of Asset Type

The Asset Type is a string designed to uniquely identify the types of assets in a developer-friendly fashion.

### Syntax

The `asset_type` is a case-sensitive string in the form

```
asset_type:    chain_id + "/" + asset_namespace + ":" + asset_reference
chain_id:          Blockchain ID Specification cf. CAIP2
asset_namespace:   [-a-z0-9]{3,8}
asset_reference:   [-a-zA-Z0-9]{1,64}
```

## Specification of Asset ID

The Asset ID is a string designed to uniquely identify a non-fungible asset in a developer-friendly fashion.

### Syntax

The `asset_id` is a case-sensitive string in the form

```
asset_id:    asset_type + "/" + token_id
token_id:   [-a-zA-Z0-9]{1,78}
```

### Semantics

Each `asset_namespace` covers a class of similar assets.
Usually, it describes an ecosystem or standard, such as e.g. `slip44` or `erc20`.
One asset_namespace should include as many assets as possible.
`asset_reference` is a way to identify an asset within a given asset_namespace.
The semantics as well as the more granular syntax of the reference, are delegated to ecosystem specific documents, to be expected as separate CAIPs.

## Rationale

The goals of the general asset type and asset ID format is:

- Uniqueness within the entire asset ecosystem
- To some degree human-readable and helps for basic debugging
- Restricted in a way that it can be stored on-chain
- Character set basic enough to display in hardware wallets as part of a transaction content

The following secondary goals can easily be achieved:

- Can be used unescaped in URL paths
- Can be used as a filename in a case-sensitive UNIX file system (Linux/git).

Those secondary goals have been given up along the way:

- Can be used as a filename in a case-insensitive UNIX file system (macOS).
- Can be used as a filename in a Windows file system.

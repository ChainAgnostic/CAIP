## Simple Summary

CAIP-25 defines an authorization procedure for a chain agnostic provider to
interface with a wallet as part of their initialization and/or "handshake"
protocol.

## Abstract

This proposal has the goal to define a standard procedure for decentralized
applications to interface with cryptocurrency wallets which govern accounts on
multiple chains and defining a set of rules to be followed during a session
managed by a provider construct.

## Motivation

The motivation comes from the lack of standardization across blockchains to
expose accounts and define the expected JSON-RPC methods to be used by an
application through a provider connecting to a wallet.

## Specification

The provider is defined within a session once the handshake procedure is
successfully approved by a wallet, and updated, extended, closed, etc by events.
These are out of scope of this CAIP interface and will be specified in a
forthcoming one.

Within that session model, this interface outlines the authorization of an
injected provider per namespace.

### Request

The application would interface with a provider to authorize a provider with a
given set of parameters by calling the following JSON-RPC request

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "provider_authorization",
    "params": {
        "eip155": {
            "chains": ["eip155:1"],
            "methods": ["eth_sendTransaction", "eth_signTransaction", "eth_sign", "personal_sign"]
            "events": ["accountsChanged", "chainChanged"]
        },
        "cosmos": {
            ...
        }
    },

}
```

The JSON-RPC method is labelled as `provider_authorization` and expects one or
more objects each named after the pertinent ChainAgnostic namespace and each
containing with three parameters:

- chains - array of CAIP-2 compliant chainId's
- methods - array of JSON-RPC methods expected to be used during the session
- events - array of JSON-RPC message/events expected to be emitted during the
  session

### Response

The wallet can respond to this method with either a success result or an error message.

#### Success

The response MUST be a success result when the user approved accounts matching
the requested chains to be exposed and the requested methods to be used.

An example of a successful response should match the following format:

```jsonc
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "accounts": ["eip155:1:0xab16a96d359ec26a11e2c2b3d8f8b8942d5bfcdb"]
  }
}
```

The accounts returned as a result should match the requested `chainId`s and
should be an array of CAIP-10 compliant `accountId`s.

#### Failure States

The response MUST NOT be a success result when the user disapproves the accounts
matching the requested chains to be exposed or the requested methods are not
approved or the requested chains are not supported by the wallet or the
requested methods are not supported.

An example of an error response should match the following format:

```jsonc
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": 5000,
    "message": "User disapproved requested chains"
  }
}
```

The valid error messages codes are the following:

- When user disapproves exposing accounts to requested chains
  - code = 5000
  - message = "User disapproved requested chains"
- When user disapproves accepting calls with the request methods
  - code = 5001
  - message = "User disapproved requested methods"
- When user disapproves accepting calls with the request events
  - code = 5002
  - message = "User disapproved requested events"
- When wallet evaluates requested chains to not be supported
  - code = 5100
  - message = "Requested chains are not supported"
- When wallet evaluates requested methods to not be supported
  - code = 5101
  - message = "Requested methods are not supported"
- When wallet evaluates requested events to not be supported
  - code = 5102
  - message = "Requested events are not supported"

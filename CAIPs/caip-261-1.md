## Simple Summary

CAIP-261 introduces a data framework to represent trust assertions among peers, facilitating the development of a global and chain-agnostic web of trust.

## Abstract

Web of trust constitutes peer-to-peer trust graphs through mutual endorsements or disputes among peers, facilitating a wide range of reputation based systems.

This proposal outlines a comprehensive data framework designed to facilitate the representation, management and verification of trust assertions for peers within a decentralized environment.

The proposed data framework is designed to be flexible, extensible, and scalable, ensuring compatibility across any chain and supporting any reputation based user-case.

By establishing a common language for trust assertions, CAIP-261 enables diverse systems and communities to interoperate with a shared understanding of trust, paving the way for permissionless systems.

## Specification

### Trust Representation

#### Identifier Scheme

Trust assertions are made about, and by, peers identifiable through any form of public key derivatives, effectively binded to owners.

Identification of peers SHOULD utilize cryptographic keys:
- [Decentralized Identifiers][DID] offering flexibility to employ interoperably any key pair-based method,
- On-chain public addresses in the context of on-chain attestations.

- DID:PKH (Public Key Hash): This method is designed to be chain-agnostic, allowing for the creation of DIDs based on public key hashes from various blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana). This universality facilitates interoperability and simplifies identity management across different ecosystems.
- DID:Key: This method generates DIDs directly from a variety of cryptographic public keys, supporting multiple key types (e.g., Ed25519, RSA). This method is straightforward and self-contained, requiring no interaction with blockchain networks, which makes it fast and cost-effective for operations that don't need decentralized verification.
- DID:web: Though not directly tied to key pairs in the same way as others, DID:Web utilizes domain names to create DIDs, enabling organizations to leverage their existing domain infrastructure for identity purposes. This method bridges traditional web infrastructure with the decentralized identity ecosystem, enhancing trust and verifiability through well-known web standards.
- DID tight to a blockchain such as DID:btcr, DID:ethr, DID:sol...

#### Data Model

All subsequent documents adhere to the [Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) for representation purposes.
However this standard does not prescribe any specific document type, even though internationally recognized standards are recommended.
The standard presumes that both the `issuer` property will be dereferenced and the complete contents of the `credentialSubject` will be consumed only after the wire-formats and signed-envelopes have been verified.

**Peer Trust Assertion:**

Modeling trust and distrust towards an individual or entity can be a complex task due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of trust.
This standard proposes the following conceptualization for the trust concept:

- `scope`: This defines the applicable trust perimeter (`scope` should be a noun);
- `level`: This defines the extent of trust;
- `reason` (optional): This defines the motivation of the trust according to some tagging system or other dictionary shared across producers and consumers; whether trust signals should be ignored or downweighted if they contain unknown entries in this array is an important design question for such systems.

The `level` of trust must remain within the following range: [-1,1]. This could be interpreted as follows: `Very low` (-1), `Low` (-0.5), `Neutral` (0), `High` (0.5), `Very High` (1).

The `scope` has reference values for interoperability purposes, but also need to be extendable to fit any use-case (cf. below [Scope of Trust Data Model](#scope-of-trust-data-model)).

**Assertion of distrust to a peer:**

```json
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "TrustCredential"],
"issuanceDate": "2024-02-15T07:05:56.273Z",

  "trustworthiness":
  [
    {
      "scope": "Honesty",
      "level": -1
      "reason": ["Scam", "Rug pull"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "Data protection",
      "level": -1,
      "reason": ["Data monetization", "Data leak"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "Software security",
      "level": -0.5,
      "reason": ["Poor track record", "Lack of transparency"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "User experience design",
      "level": -0.5,
      "reason": ["Poor UX"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "Lawful",
      "level": -1,
      "reason": ["Money laundering", "Piracy", "Non-compliance"]
    }
  ]
},
"proof": {}
```

This standard introduce the folowing references abilities/inabilities as initial scopes of trust/distrust: `Software security`, `Software development`, `Data protection`, `User experience design`; as well as the following references qualities/flows : `Honesty`, `Reliability`. These scopes are not prescriptive, but serve as guidance to achieve higher interoperability. They can be reviewed or extended by inheriting high-level scopes to accomodate any use-case.

### Trust Verification

Assertions MUST be signed, to guarantee their verfiability.

## Rationale

### Using cryptographic keys for peers identity
These identifiers and keys are designed to be self-verifying, which means they can prove their authenticity independently without relying on a centralized registry or authority. 
This self-sufficiency not only enhances security by reducing potential points of failure and attack but also promotes privacy and user control. 
Individuals and entities can manage their identities and trust relationships directly, without intermediation, facilitating a more decentralized and resilient digital ecosystem.

[Decentralized identifiers][DID] using the `pkh` and `key` methods allow for the identification of account owners or trust computers in a chain-agnostic manner without the complexity of on-chain resolution.

### Using content identifier for assertions
[Content Identifiers][CID] enable anyone to deterministically generate identifiers based on the canonicalized content of a given JSON document, and store it in a compact, tamper-evident way conducive to merging, syncing, or even CRDT patterns.

### Agnostic data model
- Flexible data ranges leveraging floats type facilitating the creation of tailored user experiences,
- Data structures has been designed to be use-case agnostic, enabling the reusability of the data across different use-cases.


### Trust modeling

1. Trust in an individual or entity is based on their qualities, or their abilities; it is not binary and evolves over time,
2. Distrust assertions allow for the capture of suspicious behaviors,

## Privacy Considerations
<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->
Issuing assertions makes public the opinion of issuers (identified by their public address), and therefore should be informed about the consequence of their action.

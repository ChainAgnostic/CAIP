## Simple Summary

CAIP-261 defines a standardized data structure for modeling trust assertions among peers, facilitating the development of a decentralized web of trust.

## Abstract

This proposal introduces a comprehensive data framework designed to model and facilitate trust assertions among peers within a decentralized environment.
By establishing a robust structure for these assertions, it lays the foundational groundwork for creating a dynamic and scalable web of trust for the decentralized web across a wide range of use cases.
By establishing a common language for trust assertions, CAIP-261 enables diverse systems and communities to interoperate with a shared understanding of trust, paving the way for any use cases willing to leverage web of trust.

## Specification

### Identifier Scheme

Within a web of trust, each peer is represented by the binding between a public key and its owner.
The identification of peers utilizes [Decentralized Identifiers][DID] offering flexibility to employ any key pair-based method in an interoperable manner.

- DID:PKH (Public Key Hash): This method is designed to be chain-agnostic, allowing for the creation of DIDs based on public key hashes from various blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana). This universality facilitates interoperability and simplifies identity management across different ecosystems.
- DID:Key: This method generates DIDs directly from a variety of cryptographic public keys, supporting multiple key types (e.g., Ed25519, RSA). This method is straightforward and self-contained, requiring no interaction with blockchain networks, which makes it fast and cost-effective for operations that don't need decentralized verification.
- DID:web: Though not directly tied to key pairs in the same way as others, DID:Web utilizes domain names to create DIDs, enabling organizations to leverage their existing domain infrastructure for identity purposes. This method bridges traditional web infrastructure with the decentralized identity ecosystem, enhancing trust and verifiability through well-known web standards.
- DID tight to a blockchain such as DID:btcr, DID:ethr, DID:sol...

### Data Model

All subsequent documents adhere to the [Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) for representation purposes.
However this standard does not prescribe any specific document type, even though internationally recognized standards are recommended.
The standard presumes that both the `issuer` property will be dereferenced and the complete contents of the `credentialSubject` will be consumed only after the wire-formats and signed-envelopes have been verified.

**Peer Trust Assertion:**

Modeling trust and distrust towards an individual or entity can be a complex task due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of trust.
This standard proposes the following conceptualization for the trust concept:

- `scope`: This defines the applicable trust perimeter (`scope` should be a noun);
- `level`: This defines the extent of trust;
- `reason` (optional): This defines the motivation of the trust according to some tagging system or other dictionary shared across producers and consumers; whether trust signals should be ignored or downweighted if they contain unknown entries in this array is an important design question for such systems.

The `level` of trust must remain within the following range: [-1,1]. This could be interpreted as follows: `Very low` (-1), `Low` (-0.5), `Neutral` (0), `High` (0.5), `Very High` (1).

The `scope` has reference values for interoperability purposes, but also need to be extendable to fit any use-case (cf. below [Scope of Trust Data Model](#scope-of-trust-data-model)).

**Assertion of distrust to a peer:**

```json
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "TrustCredential"],
"issuanceDate": "2024-02-15T07:05:56.273Z",

{
  "id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xC3764761E297D6f121e79C32A65829Cd1dDb4D33",
  "trustworthiness":
  [
    {
      "scope": "Honesty",
      "level": -1
      "reason": ["Scam", "Rug pull"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "Data protection",
      "level": -1,
      "reason": ["Data monetization", "Data leak"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "Software security",
      "level": -0.5,
      "reason": ["Poor track record", "Lack of transparency"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "User experience design",
      "level": -0.5,
      "reason": ["Poor UX"]
    },
    {
      "scope": "Lawful",
      "level": -1,
      "reason": ["Money laundering", "Piracy", "Non-compliance"]
    }
  ]
},
"proof": {}
```

This standard introduce the folowing references abilities/inabilities as initial scopes of trust/distrust: `Software security`, `Software development`, `Data protection`, `User experience design`; as well as the following references qualities/flows : `Honesty`, `Reliability`. These scopes are not prescriptive, but serve as guidance to achieve higher interoperability. They can be reviewed or extended by inheriting high-level scopes to accomodate any use-case.

## Rationale

### Modularity and extensibility

The standard has been designed with modularity and solution-agnosticism, to maximize flexibility and reusability:

- Data elements are independent from each other, allowing for the use of only a subset of it,
- Flexible data ranges leveraging floats type facilitating the creation of tailored user experiences,
- Data structures has been designed to be agnostic, enabling the reusability of the data across different use-cases.

### Identification

[DID][]s and [CID][] are decentralized identification methods that are not reliant on any centralized identity provider, making them more sustainable.

1. [Decentralized identifiers][DID] using the `pkh` and `key` methods allow for the identification of account owners or trust computers in a chain-agnostic manner without the complexity of on-chain resolution.
2. [Content Identifiers][CID] enable anyone to deterministically generate identifiers based on the canonicalized content of a given JSON document, and store it in a compact, tamper-evident way conducive to merging, syncing, or even CRDT patterns.

### Data

1. Trust in an individual or entity is based on their qualities, or their abilities; it is not binary and evolves over time,
2. Distrust assertions allow for the capture of suspicious behaviors,

## Privacy Considerations
<!--Please add an explicit list of intra-actor assumptions and known risk factors if applicable. Any normative definition of an interface requires these to be implementable; assumptions and risks should be at both individual interaction/use-case scale and systemically, should the interface specified gain ecosystem-namespace adoption. -->
Issuing assertions makes public the opinion of issuers (identified by their public address), and therefore should be informed about the consequence of their action.

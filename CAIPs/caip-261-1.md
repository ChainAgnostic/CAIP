## Simple Summary

CAIP-261 introduces a data framework to represent trust assertions among peers, facilitating the development of a global web of trust.

## Abstract

A web of trust establishes peer-to-peer trust graphs through trust and/or distrust assertions among peers, offering the possibility to calculate valuable insights such as reputation scores by using graph theory.

This proposal outlines a comprehensive data framework designed to facilitate the representation, management and verification of explicit trust assertions for peers within a decentralized environment.

The proposed data framework is designed to be flexible, extensible, and scalable, ensuring compatibility across any ecosystem and facilitating a wide range of reputation based use-cases.

By establishing a common language for peer trust assertions, CAIP-261 enables diverse ecosystems to interoperate with a shared understanding of trust, benefiting from each other and creating synergies that strengthen trust insights.

## Specification

CAIP-261 outlines the methods for representing peer trust assertions, managing their lifecycle, and verifying their authenticity. The application of graph theory to utilize these assertions is beyond the scope of this proposal, but some examples are provided.

### Trust Representation

In the following diagram, we depict the process where an issuer formally asserts their trust in a subject, highlighting the foundational relationship within a peer-to-peer trust-based system.

#### Identifier Scheme

##### Peers identification
Trust assertions are made about, and by, peers identifiable through any form of public key derivatives, effectively bound to their owners.

Identification of peers SHOULD be done with [Decentralized Identifiers][DID] to ensure interoperability, with a preference for DID methods that are based on cryptographic keys, due to their inherent autonomy.

- **did:pkh (Public Key Hash):** This method is designed to be chain-agnostic, allowing for the creation of DIDs based on public key hashes from various blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana). This universality facilitates interoperability and simplifies identity management across different ecosystems.
- **did:key:** This method generates DIDs directly from a variety of cryptographic public keys, supporting multiple key types (e.g., Ed25519, RSA). This method is straightforward and self-contained, requiring no interaction with blockchain networks, which makes it fast and cost-effective for operations that don't need decentralized verification.
- **did:web:** Though not directly tied to key pairs in the same way as others, DID:Web utilizes domain names to create DIDs, enabling organizations to leverage their existing domain infrastructure for identity purposes. This method bridges traditional web infrastructure with the decentralized identity ecosystem, enhancing trust and verifiability through well-known web standards.
- Blockhain tight DID such as did:btcr, did:ethr, did:sol, etc.

##### Assertions identification
Assertions themselves need to be identifiable and can use a [Content Identifier][CID], which is self-containt and facilitates their unique identification and retrieval. 
To complement the CID, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as ipfs, SHOULD be employed to provide a resolvable address for accessing the assertion.

#### Data Model

All subsequent documents conform to the [Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) for the purpose of representation. 
However, this standard does not prescribe any specific document type, though it may recommend internationally recognized standards. 

**Peer Trust Assertions:**

Modeling trust and distrust towards an individual or entity can be a complex task due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of trust.
This standard proposes the following conceptualization for the trust concept:

- `scope`: This defines the applicable trust perimeter. It SHOULD be a noun. Standards based on this CAIP can propose reference lists of "scope" to facilitate interoperability across different systems.
- `level`: This defines the extent of trust. It MUST remain within the following range: [-1,1]. This could be translated as follows: 'Very low' (-1), 'Low' (-0.5), 'Neutral' (0), 'High' (0.5), 'Very High' (1);
- `reason` (optional): This defines the motivation of the trust. It COULD be based according to some tagging system or other dictionary shared across producers and consumers;

#### Validity limitation
Trust, being inherently dynamic, can be managed within the document by specifying a validity period, after which the credential must be renewed to maintain its validity.
A validity limitation can be introduced with the fields `validFrom` and `validUntil`.
```json
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "TrustCredential"],
"issuanceDate": "2024-02-15T07:05:56.273Z",
"issuer": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x44dc4E3309B80eF7aBf41C7D0a68F0337a88F044",
"validFrom": "2024-01-01T19:23:24Z",
"validUntil": "2025-01-01T19:23:24Z",
```

### Trust Management
First, issued trust assertions should be properly persisted to ensure their availability for consumption. 
Then, as trust between peers evolves over time, CAIP-261 outlines a method for managing the entire lifecycle of these assertions, encompassing their creation, update, and eventual revocation.

#### Trust peristance
Peer Trust Assertions SHOULD be persisted using mechanisms that ensure immutability and prevent any unauthorized alteration or censorship. 
This includes ensuring data availability and employing tamper-proof technologies to safeguard the integrity of the assertions.

#### Trust modification
When a trust assertion needs to be updated, the issuer generates a new assertion with the updated information. 
This new assertion will have its own unique identifier and will reference the identifier of the credential it's updating in the `credentialStatus`.

**Update of trust assertion:**
```json
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "TrustCredential"],
"issuanceDate": "2024-02-29T14:31:56.273Z",
"issuer": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x44dc4E3309B80eF7aBf41C7D0a68F0337a88F044",
"credentialStatus": {
    "id": "ipfs://QmcwYEnWysTyepjjtJw19oTDwuiopbCDbEcCuprCBiL7gt",
    "type": "BitstringStatusListEntry",
    "statusPurpose": "update",
    "statusListIndex": "94567",
    "statusListCredential": "https://snaps.example/credentials/status/3",
},
```
#### Trust revocation
Similarly, when a trust assertion needs to be revoked, the issuer generates a new assertion. 
This new assertion will have its own unique identifier and will reference the identifier of the revoked credential.

**Revocation of trust assertion:**
```json
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "TrustCredential"],
"issuanceDate": "2024-02-29T14:31:56.273Z",
"issuer": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0x44dc4E3309B80eF7aBf41C7D0a68F0337a88F044",
"credentialStatus": {
    "id": "ipfs://QmcwYEnWysTyepjjtJw19oTDwuiopbCDbEcCuprCBiL7gt",
    "type": "BitstringStatusListEntry",
    "statusPurpose": "revocation",
    "statusListIndex": "94567",
    "statusListCredential": "https://snaps.example/credentials/status/3",
},
```
#### Implicit Trust
The Peer Trust Assertion model outlined previously focuses on explicit trust signals, enabling trust assessments to be enhanced with additional implicit on-chain and/or off-chain trust signals related to its peers. These can include Proof of Humanity, Proof of Membership, Proof of Contributions, Proof of Attendance, Social Graphs, among others. This standard does not define the handling of implicit trust; it leaves the integration of relevant data to the discretion of the final consumer, depending on the specific use-case.

### Trust assertion Verification

The standard presumes that both the `issuer` property will be dereferenced and the complete contents of the `credentialSubject` will be consumed only after the wire-formats and signed-envelopes have been verified.

#### Signature verification

The veracity and integrity of trust assertions is fundamental to prevent biaises insights. 
Therefore all trust assertions SHOULD be cryptographically signed by the issuer, by strong cryptography.

- **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):** ECDSA is widely used across various blockchain platforms, including Ethereum. It offers a strong level of security with a shorter key length, making it efficient for on-chain transactions. ECDSA signatures are compact, which helps in keeping the transaction sizes and, consequently, the transaction fees lower.

- **EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm):** EdDSA, and specifically its Ed25519 variant, is known for its high performance and security. It is designed to be faster and more secure against certain types of cryptographic attacks compared to other signature schemes. Ed25519 is suitable for systems requiring high-speed operations and robust security, making it an excellent choice for blockchain applications.

- **Schnorr Signatures:** Schnorr signatures offer several advantages, including non-malleability, linearity, and the ability to create multi-signatures. Although not as widely adopted as ECDSA in current blockchain platforms, Schnorr signatures are gaining attention for their potential to enhance privacy and efficiency, particularly in the context of Bitcoin and related technologies.

- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):** While RSA is not as commonly used in blockchain applications due to its larger key and signature sizes, it remains one of the most secure and widely trusted cryptographic algorithms. RSA might be considered for specific use cases where its extensive adoption and security track record are deemed beneficial, despite the higher computational and storage requirements.

EIP-712 should be considered a complementary cryptographic proof method alongside others like ECDSA, EdDSA, Schnorr, and RSA for on-chain verifiable credentials. Its inclusion emphasizes the importance of user-friendly, secure, and efficient interactions with blockchain-based identity and credential systems, particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem.
EIP-712 require to have all fields present, event if their value is empty.

```json
  "proof": {
      "verificationMethod": "did:pkh:eip155:59144:0x3892967AA898d7EeBf1B08d3E1F31B2F4C84317A#blockchainAccountId",
      "created": "2024-01-27T07:05:56.273Z",
      "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
      "type": "EthereumEip712Signature2021"
  }
```

#### Format verification
The Assertions SHOULD follow the defined schema for validation. For verifiable credentials, this is specified within the "context" field.

#### Validity verification
The validity of assertions can depends on additional metadata:
- validity period (`validFrom`, `validUntil`), 
- new assertions issuance with status change (`revocation`, `update`).

### Consumption

Following verification, this data can be utilized by any consumer for various use-cases, as this standard remains neutral regarding the aspect of consumption. However, the standard does offer some guidelines to ensure integrity and transparency in the use of trust data:

- Calculations made using the established trust graph should be fully provable, necessitating the disclosure of all sourced data and the computation algorithm used. This level of transparency guarantees that trust-based calculations are both replicable and verifiable, allowing any interested party to understand or question the outcomes.
- Trust assertions may be disregarded or given less weight if they include entries that are not recognized

**Reputation calculation**
The consumption of the trust graph typically involves recursive calculations across the graph, following specific rules, to derive a reputation score. This process can utilize various existing or newly developed algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of the trust graph.

## Rationale

### Using cryptographic keys for peers identity
These identifiers and keys are designed to be self-verifying, which means they can prove their authenticity independently without relying on a centralized registry or authority. 
This self-sufficiency not only enhances security by reducing potential points of failure and attack but also promotes privacy and user control. 
Individuals and entities can manage their identities and trust relationships directly, without intermediation, facilitating a more decentralized and resilient digital ecosystem.

[Decentralized identifiers][DID] using the `pkh` and `key` methods allow for the identification of account owners or trust computers in a chain-agnostic manner without the complexity of on-chain resolution.

### Using content identifier for assertions
[Content Identifiers][CID] enable anyone to deterministically generate identifiers based on the canonicalized content of a given JSON document, and store it in a compact, tamper-evident way conducive to merging, syncing, or even CRDT patterns.

### Agnostic data model
- Flexible data ranges leveraging floats type facilitating the creation of tailored user experiences,
- Data structures has been designed to be use-case agnostic, enabling the reusability of the data across different use-cases.


### Trust modeling

1. Trust in an individual or entity is based on their qualities, or their abilities; it is not binary and evolves over time,
2. Distrust assertions allow for the capture of suspicious behaviors,


## Privacy Considerations
Issuing assertions makes public the opinion of issuers (identified by their public address), and therefore should be informed about the consequence of their action.

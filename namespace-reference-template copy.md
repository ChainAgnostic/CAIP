# Namespace for {non-technical name for ecosystem or family of chains}

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CAIP.-->
As the old saying goes, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
well enough." Here is where you can provide a simplified and layman-accessible
explanation of what is particular to this namespace or how it differs from EVM
chains, where the CAIPs are easiest to apply/understand.

## Rationale
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
A short (~200 word) description of any technical issues being addressed by the
naming of the namespace, or other informational asides about the particularities
of the namespace.

## Governance
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the improvement proposal process or other specification/governance context that a first-time implementer of cross-chain work in this namespace/ecosystem should know.-->
A short (~200 word) description of the improvement proposal process or other
specification/governance context that a first-time implementer of cross-chain
work in this namespace/ecosystem should know.

## References
<!--Links to external resources that help understanding the CAIP better. This can e.g. be links to existing implementations.-->
Links to external resources that help understanding the namespace or the
specification/applied-CAIP better in this context. This can also include links
to existing implementations.

The preferred format, for browser-rendering and long-term maintenance, is a
bulletted list of [Name][] links (rather than classical [Name](referent) links),
followed by ` - ` and a summary or explanation of the content.  In a separate
section below, add the name-referent pairs in the `[Name]: https://{referent} `
format-- this will be invisible in any Github-flavored Markdown rendering
(including jekyll/github pages, aka github.io, but also docusaurus and many
dev-docs rendering engines).
